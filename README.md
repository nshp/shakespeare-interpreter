Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) Interpreter
=========

This is a live interpreter for SPL, based on https://github.com/X4mp/SPL-Files
It was created by the PeakChaos CTF team at UCCS for iCTF 2015.
NOTE: It is currently intentionally vulnerable. That's the whole point. Do not use this in any kind of production environment. Ever.
